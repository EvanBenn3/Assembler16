Assembler16 is the Custom Assembler made for the Computer16 project.
It is simple and only takes in Opcodes and their parameter.
The way you use it is you put your assembly code in assembly_in.txt, run main.py, then copy the machine code in assebly_out.txt and pase it into Computer16's program.py in the program list variable
You have to use this formate of coding:
e.g
NOP
LDA 5
IDA 6
PUSHA
HALT
It has to be in seperate lines, and the parameter is seperated from the opcode.
